HTML/CSS Project - Kehler Farms by Nigel Harris

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

I am redesigning the Kehler Vegetable Company website to make it simple, user-friendly, and focused on fresh, local produce. The new design will have three clear pages: Home, Products, and Contact/Visit Us. It will be easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provide all the essential information visitors need.

### Current Site Issues

# Accessibilty

- The current homepage lacks structure, with the entire page treated as a single body element. There is no dedicated header or footer, which makes the layout feel incomplete and unorganized.

- The homepage has noticeable contrast issues, making important text hard to read due to poor color choices. Additionally, the contact information suffers from improper capitalization and inconsistent formatting, reducing the siteâ€™s professionalism.

- The navigation buttons do not redirect users to new pages. Instead, they only update content within the same page, which can be confusing. A proper navigation system should provide clear transitions between pages for a better user experience.

- Most if not all image elements do not have alt attributes affecting usability for screen reader users.

- The html element does not have a [lang] attribute which helps to ensure a more personalized experience for users.

# Speed

- The large assortment of images in the gallery slows down loading time.
